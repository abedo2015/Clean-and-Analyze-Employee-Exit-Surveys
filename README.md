# Clean-and-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys
Analyzing possible reasons for employee dissatisfaction

For this project, we will be focusing on two datasets that focus on the satisfaction/dissatisfaction that employees faced during their time at an institute. The Data was provided from employees of the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) instutute.

By the end of this project, we wish to answer the following questions:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

We will be working with two datasets: the "dete_survey.csv" and the "tafe_survey.csv" files. We will combine the two datasets and attempt to clean the final dataset appropriately for future analysis.
